                Ever been excited to grab something at Grabbo, only to be let down when it's not there? Or thought they wouldn't have what you wanted, only to find out they did? It's a bummer, especially when Grabbo is a trek from the hostels. So, we had this idea â€“
                what if there was a way for you to check if Grabbo has what you need before making the journey? That way, you can save yourself the hassle and decide if it's worth the trip to the arcade. Cool, right?
